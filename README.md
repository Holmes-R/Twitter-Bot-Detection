# Twitter-Bot-Detection

This project focuses on detecting bot accounts on Twitter using machine learning techniques. By analyzing features extracted from user metadata, it aims to classify whether an account is a bot or a human.


## Dataset

The dataset used is training_data_2_csv_UTF.csv, which contains labeled Twitter account data. The key feature is a binary label bot indicating if an account is a bot (1) or a human (0).

##  How do I detect a bot?
  
  Some typical characteristics of bots on Twitter include:
    Many Twitter bots have a relatively recent creation date.
    Many bot user names contain numbers, which can indicate automatic name generation.
    The account primarily retweets content, rather than tweeting original content.
    The accountâ€™s tweet frequency is higher than a human user could feasibly achieve.
    The account may have a high number of followers and also be following a lot of accounts; conversely, some bot accounts are identifiable because they send a lot of tweets but only have a few followers.
    Many bots tweet the same content as other users at roughly the same time.
    Short replies to other tweets can also indicate automated behavior.
    There is often no biography, or indeed a photo, associated with bot Twitter accounts.
